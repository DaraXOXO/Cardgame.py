Welcome to my card game!
My main function will 
Create one deck
shuffle the deck
Create both players
Populate the player's hands with 5 cards each
Display the player's hands
Display the number of Ace cards in each playerâ€™s hand
Display the winner.
If the game ends in a tie, then restart the game from step a.

 The player will both have ace cards so there is no winner.
